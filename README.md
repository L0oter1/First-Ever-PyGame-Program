This code was when I first learned python and wanted to experiment with pygame. 

I made this game for my friends which is why I name dropped a bunch of people and their personal life stuff. 

If you're looking at this from an outside perspective, just ignore the names and play for fun. :)

Hint: you might need to figure out the controls and some broken physics by reading the code. 

The exe file doesnt work because with the way I compiled it, when you download it your windows will probably say it's a virus so I would recommend you download the code and run it on your own computer. 

The physics being bad is intentional, just kidding I didn't knoww what I was doing. I just wanted to make a platform game but failed. 

Anyways good luck.
